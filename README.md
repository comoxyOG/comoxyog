# Comoxy OG

## Overview
Comoxy OG is a community-driven launcher and tooling project that helps you play older versions of Fortnite through curated commands, a launcher, and setup guides. Downloadable releases are published on the Comoxy GitHub so you can get started without digging through source code.

## What Comoxy is (and isn’t)
Comoxy itself is not a “Fortnite builds archive.” It’s the launcher, commands, and setup resources used to run OG experiences. Builds referenced by the community may be external; Comoxy focuses on the tooling and instructions required to launch them.

## Features
- **Launcher releases:** Prebuilt downloads to quickly set up and run Comoxy OG without compiling.
- **Commands and cheats:** A dedicated commands/cheats repository to configure behavior in OG sessions.
- **Guides:** Community-written docs on making and running old Fortnite projects.
- **Walkthroughs:** Short videos showing how to use Comoxy and common commands (e.g., “open 127.0.0.1”).

## Installation
1. **Get the latest Comoxy release:** Download from the Comoxy GitHub releases page for a ready-to-run build.
2. **Extract and open the launcher:** Unzip the downloaded archive and run the launcher executable.
3. **Configure basics:** Follow the release notes and guide prompts; many tutorials reference simple commands like `open 127.0.0.1` to start local sessions.
4. **Optional extras:** If you need specific commands or cheats, grab them from the Comoxy Commands/Cheats repository.

## Quick start
- **Run the launcher** and select your setup option.
- (run the game server) and run new fortnite.
- **Use the documented commands** (`open 127.0.0.1`) to initialize a local session as shown in Comoxy’s tutorial videos.
- **Adjust configs** using the commands/cheats repo for fine-tuning behavior.

## Project structure
- **comoxyogfn (releases):** Primary distribution with downloadable builds of the Comoxy launcher.
- **FortniteComoxyCommands-Cheats:** Commands and cheats tailored for Comoxy sessions.
- **How-to-Make-an-old-Fortnite-project:** Guides and documentation for setup and experimentation.

## Community and support
- **YouTube tutorials:** Short videos demonstrate setup and usage, including common commands and Discord info for community support.
